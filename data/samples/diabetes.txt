Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production, ineffective insulin action, or both.

## Types
1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: A condition where cells become resistant to insulin or the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin.
3. **Gestational Diabetes**: Occurs during pregnancy and typically resolves after delivery.

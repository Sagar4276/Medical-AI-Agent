# Asthma Information

## What is Asthma?

Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways (bronchi) in the lungs. When someone has asthma, their airways become inflamed, narrow, and produce extra mucus, making it difficult to breathe.

## Types of Asthma

### 1. Allergic Asthma
- Triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold
- Most common type of asthma
- Often develops in childhood
- May be seasonal based on allergen exposure

### 2. Non-Allergic Asthma
- Triggered by factors other than allergens
- Can develop at any age
- Triggers include respiratory infections, stress, weather changes
- Less predictable than allergic asthma

### 3. Exercise-Induced Asthma
- Symptoms triggered by physical activity
- Airways narrow during or after exercise
- Can affect people with or without chronic asthma
- More common in cold, dry air

### 4. Occupational Asthma
- Caused by workplace irritants or allergens
- Symptoms may improve away from work
- Common in certain professions (healthcare, cleaning, manufacturing)

## Symptoms of Asthma

### Common Symptoms
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Wheezing (whistling sound when breathing)
- Coughing, especially at night or early morning
- Difficulty sleeping due to breathing problems

### Severe Symptoms (Seek Emergency Care)
- Severe shortness of breath
- Inability to speak in full sentences
- Blue lips or fingernails
- Rapid pulse
- Severe wheezing or coughing

## Triggers

### Common Asthma Triggers
- Allergens (pollen, dust, pet dander, mold)
- Respiratory infections (colds, flu)
- Physical activity
- Cold air
- Air pollutants and irritants
- Strong emotions and stress
- Certain medications (aspirin, beta-blockers)
- Food additives (sulfites)
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

## Treatment Options

### Quick-Relief Medications (Rescue Inhalers)
- Short-acting beta agonists (albuterol)
- Provide rapid relief during asthma attacks
- Should be carried at all times
- Not for daily use

### Long-term Control Medications
- Inhaled corticosteroids (most effective)
- Long-acting beta agonists
- Leukotriene modifiers
- Theophylline
- Taken daily to prevent symptoms

### Alternative Treatments
- Allergy medications for allergic asthma
- Immunotherapy (allergy shots)
- Bronchial thermoplasty for severe asthma

## Management Strategies

### Asthma Action Plan
- Work with healthcare provider to create personalized plan
- Know your triggers and how to avoid them
- Understand when to take medications
- Know when to seek emergency care

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Identify and avoid triggers
- Maintain healthy weight
- Exercise regularly (with proper precautions)
- Get vaccinated against flu and pneumonia
- Manage stress
- Monitor symptoms regularly

### Environmental Control
- Use air purifiers
- Keep humidity levels between 30-50%
- Regular cleaning to reduce dust and allergens
- Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke
- Wash bedding in hot water weekly

## Prevention

### Primary Prevention
- Breastfeeding (may reduce asthma risk in children)
- Avoiding tobacco smoke during pregnancy and childhood
- Limiting exposure to allergens in early life

### Secondary Prevention
- Proper management of existing asthma
- Regular medical check-ups
- Following medication regimen
- Monitoring lung function

## When to See a Doctor

### Regular Check-ups
- At least once a year for asthma review
- More frequent visits if symptoms are not well controlled
- After any asthma attack or change in symptoms

### Emergency Situations
- Difficulty breathing or speaking
- Peak flow readings in red zone
- No improvement after using rescue inhaler
- Signs of respiratory distress

## Living with Asthma

### Daily Management
- Take medications as prescribed
- Monitor symptoms and peak flow
- Avoid known triggers
- Stay active with appropriate precautions
- Maintain good communication with healthcare team

### Long-term Outlook
- With proper management, most people with asthma can live normal, active lives
- Regular monitoring and adjustment of treatment plan
- Technology advances continue to improve treatment options

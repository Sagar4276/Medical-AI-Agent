# Obesity Information

## What is Obesity?

Obesity is a complex medical condition characterized by excessive accumulation of body fat that may impair health. It's typically measured using Body Mass Index (BMI), with obesity defined as a BMI of 30 or higher. Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide and increases the risk of numerous health complications.

## Understanding BMI and Weight Classifications

### BMI Categories
- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI 18.5-24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25-29.9
- Obesity Class I: BMI 30-34.9
- Obesity Class II: BMI 35-39.9
- Obesity Class III (Severe): BMI 40 or higher

### BMI Limitations
- Doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat
- May not accurately reflect health status in athletes
- Different considerations for different ethnic groups
- Doesn't account for body fat distribution

### Alternative Measurements
- Waist circumference
- Waist-to-hip ratio
- Body fat percentage
- Waist-to-height ratio

## Types of Obesity

### Android Obesity (Apple Shape)
- Fat accumulation around abdomen and upper body
- More common in men
- Associated with higher health risks
- Linked to metabolic complications

### Gynoid Obesity (Pear Shape)
- Fat accumulation around hips and thighs
- More common in women
- Generally lower health risks than android obesity
- May be protective against some metabolic diseases

### Visceral vs. Subcutaneous Fat
- Visceral fat: around internal organs (higher risk)
- Subcutaneous fat: under the skin (lower risk)
- Visceral fat more metabolically active and harmful

## Causes of Obesity

### Energy Imbalance

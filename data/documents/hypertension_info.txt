# Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) Information

## What is Hypertension?

Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a condition where the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It's often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms but can lead to serious health complications if left untreated.

## Understanding Blood Pressure

### Blood Pressure Readings
- Systolic pressure: pressure when heart beats (top number)
- Diastolic pressure: pressure when heart rests between beats (bottom number)
- Measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg)
- Written as systolic/diastolic (e.g., 120/80 mmHg)

### Blood Pressure Categories
- Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg
- Elevated: Systolic 120-129 and diastolic less than 80
- Stage 1 Hypertension: Systolic 130-139 or diastolic 80-89
- Stage 2 Hypertension: Systolic 140/90 or higher
- Hypertensive Crisis: Systolic over 180 and/or diastolic over 120

## Types of Hypertension

### Primary (Essential) Hypertension
- Most common type (90-95% of cases)
- No identifiable cause
- Develops gradually over years
- Risk factors include genetics, lifestyle, and aging

### Secondary Hypertension
- Caused by underlying medical condition
- Usually appears suddenly and causes higher blood pressure
- Conditions include kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems
- Certain medications can also cause secondary hypertension

## Symptoms

### Early Stages
- Often no symptoms (silent condition)
- May feel normal despite elevated blood pressure
- Importance of regular blood pressure checks

### Severe Hypertension Symptoms
- Headaches
- Shortness of breath
- Nosebleeds
- Flushing
- Dizziness
- Chest pain
- Visual changes

### Hypertensive Emergency Symptoms
- Severe headache
- Severe anxiety
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea and vomiting
- Confusion
- Changes in vision
- Unresponsiveness

## Risk Factors

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Family history
- Race (higher risk in African Americans)
- Gender (men at higher risk until age 55; women after menopause)

### Modifiable Risk Factors
- Obesity
- Physical inactivity
- High sodium diet
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Smoking
- Stress
- Sleep apnea
- Diabetes
- High cholesterol

## Causes and Contributing Factors

### Lifestyle Factors
- High sodium intake
- Low potassium intake
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Chronic stress
- Poor sleep quality

### Medical Conditions
- Kidney disease
- Diabetes
- Sleep apnea
- Thyroid disorders
- Adrenal gland disorders
- Certain congenital blood vessel defects

### Medications
- Pain relievers (NSAIDs)
- Decongestants
- Birth control pills
- Some antidepressants
- Immunosuppressants

## Complications

### Cardiovascular Complications
- Heart attack
- Heart failure
- Stroke
- Coronary artery disease
- Enlarged heart
- Aortic dissection

### Other Complications
- Kidney damage or failure
- Eye damage (retinopathy)
- Sexual dysfunction
- Peripheral artery disease
- Vascular dementia

## Diagnosis

### Blood Pressure Measurement
- Multiple readings over time
- Proper technique and equipment
- Different positions and times of day
- Home blood pressure monitoring
- 24-hour ambulatory monitoring

### Additional Tests
- Urinalysis
- Blood chemistry screen
- Electrocardiogram (ECG)
- Echocardiogram
- Tests for secondary causes if suspected

## Treatment and Management

### Lifestyle Modifications
- DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
- Reduce sodium intake (less than 2,300 mg daily)
- Increase potassium-rich foods
- Maintain healthy weight
- Regular physical activity
- Limit alcohol consumption
- Quit smoking
- Manage stress
- Adequate sleep

### Medications

#### First-Line Medications
- ACE inhibitors
- Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
- Calcium channel blockers
- Thiazide diuretics

#### Other Medications
- Beta-blockers
- Alpha-blockers
- Central-acting agents
- Vasodilators
- Combination medications

### Medication Considerations
- Start with lifestyle changes
- Add medications if blood pressure remains high
- May need multiple medications
- Regular monitoring and adjustment
- Consider side effects and drug interactions

## Diet and Nutrition

### DASH Diet Principles
- Emphasizes fruits and vegetables
- Whole grains
- Lean proteins
- Low-fat dairy
- Nuts and legumes
- Limited saturated fat and sugar

### Sodium Reduction
- Read food labels
- Choose fresh over processed foods
- Cook at home more often
- Use herbs and spices instead of salt
- Limit restaurant and fast food

### Beneficial Foods
- Leafy greens (potassium)
- Berries (antioxidants)
- Bananas (potassium)
- Fatty fish (omega-3s)
- Garlic (may help lower blood pressure)
- Dark chocolate (in moderation)

## Exercise and Physical Activity

### Benefits for Blood Pressure
- Strengthens heart
- Improves blood flow
- Helps with weight management
- Reduces stress
- Can lower blood pressure by 4-9 mmHg

### Exercise Recommendations
- At least 150 minutes moderate aerobic activity per week
- 2 or more days of strength training
- Activities like walking, swimming, cycling
- Start slowly and gradually increase
- Consult healthcare provider before starting

## Monitoring and Self-Care

### Home Blood Pressure Monitoring
- Use validated, calibrated device
- Proper cuff size and technique
- Consistent timing and conditions
- Keep a log of readings
- Share results with healthcare provider

### Lifestyle Tracking
- Monitor weight
- Track physical activity
- Keep food diary
- Monitor stress levels
- Note any symptoms

## Prevention

### Primary Prevention
- Maintain healthy weight
- Regular physical activity
- Healthy diet (low sodium, high potassium)
- Limit alcohol
- Don't smoke
- Manage stress
- Regular health checkups

### Secondary Prevention
- Continue lifestyle modifications
- Take medications as prescribed
- Regular monitoring
- Manage other health conditions
- Follow up with healthcare providers

## Special Considerations

### Pregnancy and Hypertension
- Gestational hypertension
- Preeclampsia
- Chronic hypertension in pregnancy
- Special monitoring and treatment needed

### Elderly Patients
- More common with aging
- May need different treatment approach
- Risk of falls with some medications
- Isolated systolic hypertension

### Resistant Hypertension
- Blood pressure remains high despite 3+ medications
- May require specialized evaluation
- Consider secondary causes
- Lifestyle factors remain important

## Emergency Situations

### When to Seek Immediate Care
- Systolic pressure over 180 or diastolic over 120
- Severe headache
- Chest pain
- Difficulty breathing
- Visual changes
- Signs of stroke

### Hypertensive Emergency
- Requires immediate medical attention
- Blood pressure usually over 180/120
- Evidence of organ damage
- Can be life-threatening

## Living with Hypertension

### Daily Management
- Take medications consistently
- Monitor blood pressure regularly
- Maintain healthy lifestyle
- Manage stress effectively
- Stay connected with healthcare team
- Know warning signs

### Long-term Outlook
- Well-controlled hypertension has good prognosis
- Reduces risk of complications
- Lifestyle changes can be very effective
- Many people live normal, healthy lives with proper management

Remember: Hypertension is a manageable condition with proper treatment and lifestyle modifications. Regular monitoring and adherence to treatment plans are essential for preventing complications and maintaining good health.
